Hello Team,
We did check more the issue and observed, we need to revisit the HiveLLAP configuration as below:
The current configuration for LLAP:
YARN Minimum Container Size (Memory) = 1024MB
YARN.scheduler.Maximum_allocation.mb= 328704
Memory per Daemon  = 300GB
In-Memory Cache per Daemon = 71GB
Number of executors per LLAP Daemon = 59
hive.tez.container.size = 4096MB
As per the Cloudera's recommendation, the current configuration can be updated as below:
Proposed Solution: Set Tez container size = 6GB with below configuration
YARN Minimum Container Size (Memory) = 1024MB
YARN.scheduler.Maximum_allocation.mb= 328704
Memory per Daemon  = 328GB (Headroom + executors + cache)		
Headroom = 6GB
hive.tez.container.size =  6GB (Update value in Advanced hive-interactive-site)
Number of executors per LLAP Daemon = 44
LLAP heap size = 44*6 = 264 GB			
In-Memory Cache per Daemon= 328(Memory per Daemon) - 6(Headroom) - 264(Heapsize_llap) = 58GB
We can update the above configuration and keep gradually increasing the Tez container size, till we get the result.
Another thing we can also increase the no. of daemon count from 3 to 5, if required.
Thanks
